# SUMMARY: Key Differences Between Finance Core and Full Stack App

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **WACC Calculation Mismatch**
- **Finance Core**: 8.60%
- **Full Stack App**: 7.76%
- **Impact**: 16.9% difference in Enterprise Value, 29.2% difference in Equity Value

### 2. **APV Analysis Complete Failure**
- **Finance Core**: Successfully calculates APV ($1,029.6M EV)
- **Full Stack App**: Validation fails due to missing `unlevered_cost_of_equity` field

## üìä DETAILED COMPARISON

| Analysis Type | Finance Core | Full Stack App | Status |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **DCF (WACC)** | $1,453.5M EV | $1,699.4M EV | ‚ùå **DIFFERENT** |
| **APV** | $1,029.6M EV | **FAILED** | ‚ùå **BROKEN** |
| **Multiples** | $4,748.5M EV | $4,771.8M EV | ‚úÖ **SIMILAR** |
| **Scenarios** | $1,453.5M base | $1,699.4M base | ‚ùå **DIFFERENT** |
| **Sensitivity** | $1,453.5M base | $1,699.4M base | ‚ùå **DIFFERENT** |
| **Monte Carlo** | $1,477.8M mean | $1,473.1M mean | ‚úÖ **SIMILAR** |

## üîç ROOT CAUSES

1. **WACC Calculation**: Different methods used between implementations
2. **Input Validation**: Missing required fields in sample inputs
3. **Field Mapping**: Inconsistent JSON to object conversion
4. **Integration**: Full Stack App not properly connected to Finance Core

## üí° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Fix WACC calculation** to match Finance Core (8.60%)
2. **Add missing fields** to sample inputs (`unlevered_cost_of_equity`)
3. **Standardize input processing** between both implementations
4. **Add integration tests** to ensure consistency

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**The Full Stack App results are currently unreliable and should not be used for production until these issues are resolved.**
